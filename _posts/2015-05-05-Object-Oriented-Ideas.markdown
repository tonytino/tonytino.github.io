# Noon Lecture

OO is not about modeling the real-world completely in entirety (e.g. we don't need a sub class for every cookie type).
It's about creating abstractions necessary to get a job done.

``` ruby
  puts "hello"
```

*When creating a MVP program, make sure you're only building what's necessary **__based on the user stories__**. The program should support the ability to have infinite customizability rather than having all things already accounted for (e.g. making every type of cookie rather than just the template for such).*
