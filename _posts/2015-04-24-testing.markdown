This is monkey business.

And business is booming...

{% highlight ruby %}
def business_model(name)
  puts "Bananas"
end
print_hi('monkey')
#=> bananas are for monkeys
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [monkey docs][monkey] for more info on how to get the most out of bananas. Monkey can be reached at: [monkey contact][monkey-site]. If you have bananas, you can send them to [monkey's business address][monkey-house].
