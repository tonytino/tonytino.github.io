### Why No One Answered Your Question

If you've ever been asked a question and didn't know where to start, what was being asked, or even what the topic was (even if it was in regards to something you're familiar with), it's probably because the question was not asked properly. A question's context and phrasing are critical to the person being asked, particularly if they're not working on the same thing as you are. You have to give details like:

- What are you trying to accomplish?
- Where did you run into your first issue?
- What have to tried to resolve your issue?
- Is this the only means of implementing what you're trying to accomplish?
- What have you done so far (many times, showing your work is critical)?
- What limitations are you facing? Are there things that you can or cannot do based on the instructions you were given?

This list can go on and on, but the idea is that any question that requires a well-thought out response or solution also requires a lot of consideration when being asked. Imagine telling someone that you need them to buy you milk. They get to the store and see all of the different options (fat free, whole, 1%, etc.) and have no idea which is the correct one, especially when considering all of the different brands and types (organic, anybody?). When you give someone a request, it is important for you to be specific and detailed because they may not know what you know. Just the same, when asking someone a question (a request for guidance and/or assistance), you need to be detailed and specific.


### But Wait... No One Ever Tries to Help Me

If you're known for asking bad questions, this may be exactly why. It is difficult to help someone how does not ask good questions, and this usually results in no one having the answers you need. You will either become frustrated because no one is answering correctly or they will become impatient because you're not giving them what they need to help you. Either way, it's important to always make it easy for people to help you because they're the ones doing you a favor - don't make it a uphill battle for them!
