### What I liked:

Changing to Jekyll was relatively easy, but rather mundane due to the process of tranferring all of my previous posts being extremely repetitive. With that said, the reward of doing so it wonderful. Creating blog posts is now extremely easy and quick, and writing in markdown rather than html is always a plus. Getting the changes onto GitHub was really quick to because all you have to do is replace the contents of your directory with the Jekyll contents, and voila!

### What Has Been Challenging:

There wasn't anything particularly challenging about the experience aside from picking up and learning something you've never used before. Luckily, I was working with Alex Heinin and Colette Speer, two fellow Fiery Skippers, when getting everything up and running, which allowed us to go through the process together. One thing that was kind of an issue was determining which files I'm not supposed to mess with (the ones that come with Jekyll), but that doesn't require too much effort to determine. I also still need to implement Bootstrap and make it play nice with Jekyll, so that may be where the real challenge begins.
