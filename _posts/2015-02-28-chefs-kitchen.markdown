### My take on the DBC experience:

It's a very organic learning environment that caters to not only the curiosity and desire of individuals who want to learn, but also their basic needs as humans, social animals by nature. To take it a step further, they even teach the importance of being healthy physically and mentally by actions, not just through words. I think its wonderful that they have everyone embrace yoga and talking about how you feel and being aware of how others feels, whether as a result of your actions or their own experiences. There’s no question about whether you can learn to code and design at DBC, the real question is how much you want to learn and take away from the experience - I fully expect to grow as a person in many, many ways. I cannot wait to see how much I develop (and I don’t mean coding, but that too) throughout the experience.


### My impression of DBC:

They’ve got it figured out - they have been at it for a while now and they are constantly working to improve their program. They are changing the industry and expectations, they are influencing others to follow in their footsteps (supposedly other bootcamps are recruiting DBC graduates!), and you get out of it what you put in.


### How I see myself engaging with this type of culture:

I cannot imagine a more perfect culture for me to grow and develop as a person. The culture and environment is focused on learning (quickly, efficiently, and engagingly), being social and collaborative, and feeling challenged in ways that inspire you. It might be a lot of work, but they certainly know how to make it enjoyable for everyone and to keep you interested; Phase 0 is a blast in itself. Just doing the remote curriculum, I am constantly looking forward to the next challenge and seeing myself learning vast amounts quickly. I’ve already learned a great deal about my fellow cohort mates and am thrilled to meet everyone onsite - this group is full of personality and interesting people coming from so many different walks of life. I want nothing less than to be able to work with everyone and get to know about each individual involved. I fully expect to be good friends with everyone by the end, and hope that it’ll just be the beginning of many life-long friendships.

### Have my expectations of DBC changed, and if so, how?

Only in positive ways - no matter how much due diligence you do before getting into the program, there are still plenty of questions that you will have before getting started. Before getting the Phase 0 handbook, I was wondering what pairing was going to be like, what feedback was going to be like, how involved I was going to be with the other individuals in my cohort, how quickly I was going to learn, etc. Well, DBC certainly knows how to go above and beyond. Pairing, for example, is very well-constructed, and I expect each of us to be much better than many established programmers at pair programming because of: our familiarity with the concept, our developed ability to cooperate with others, and the skills we will gain regarding giving meaningful feedback.

### Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment?

Thrilled and ecstatic, absolutely jumping out of my skin in anticipation of how amazing the onsite intensive portion is going to be. Who would have thought remote learning could be so awesome and well-executed? Taking online classes in college was always such a disappointing experience, but DBC has it figured out and is only going to get better with their focus on seeking feedback from their students.

### Does it make you nervous?

Not at all, with all the support that DBC has made available and how much emphasis they have placed on providing you with the resources you need to be physically and mentally healthy, there isn’t much to be nervous about. At this point, the only pressure that exists sits on my shoulders, but I’m fully committed to this and love every bit about programming - ever since I wrote my first line of code, I’ve been in love. I want to learn as much as I can from this program, and I cannot wait to see how much more I can learn afterwards with the skills they equip me with.

### Anything else?

Please keep doing what you’re doing, it’s so clear that the folks running DBC care about their students and the community. It’s an amazing experience to be a part of, and I am excited to give back in every way that I can, whether it be teaching friends and strangers how to code (or other things, like giving quality feedback) or contributing to open-source projects.
