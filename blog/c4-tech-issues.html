      <h1 class="blog-title">Leading by Example: A Reason to be Proud</h1>

      <h4>The Problem...</h4>
      <p>
      Hispanics are largely underrepresented within the programming community, a fact that is well-known and hard to dispute.
      </p>

      <h4>The Details...</h4>

      <p>
      It isn't a secret that Hispanics are few are far between in the tech industry. According to a study conducted by USA TODAY, Hispanic graduates from top universities with CS/CE degrees struggle to land positions in the industry, despite their formal education. The study was based on staffing numbers provided by seven major companies, which revealed that roughly half of the Hispanic graduates from top universities with CS/CE degrees are able to secure positions at such companies. While the sample may be small in size, it does not come as a suprise (what company would want to reveal that it does not staff many, if any Hispanics?) and may suggest that the matter is worse than portrayed by the study (these seven companies may be those with the most Hispanics on their staff...). So, just how low are the percentages? Well, according to the study, the Hispanics that graduate from top univerisities with CS/CE degrees (representing approximately 6.5% of such graduates) only represent approximately 3.2% of tech company employees. Even if these percentages were off by -100% (i.e. they're really double of that reported), they would still be drastically low and discouraging to say the least.
      </p>

      <h4>Possible Solutions...</h4>

      <p>
      Based on the fact that only half of Hispanic CS/CE graduates from top universities find jobs in the tech industry, the issue does not seem to be a lack of supply, necessarily. While not every graduate should be able to find a job (perhaps some are not employable due to their personalities or other important skills sets aside from their education), we should still be much closer to at least 80% rather than roughly 50%. Therefore, the issue seems to be related to the hiring practices of tech companies.<br><br>One possible solution would be to create a way for talented programmers to present their skills to employers without revealing their ethnic background or their gender until the employer has decide to hire them. While this creates possible issues for the hiring process, such as interviewing without meeting face-to-face, it helps address a major issue and may result on hiring practices that are more so focused on the ability to perform. It's very possible that there are unemployed Hispanics with CS/CE degrees that are able to program and complete job requirements better than current employees of tech companies. I seek to prove this myself once I land a job within the tech industry, and my degree is in Economics! Dev Bootcamp is helping me make this happen.
