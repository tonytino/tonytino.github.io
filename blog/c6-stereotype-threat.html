      <h1 class="blog-title">Stereotype Threat: Possible Victim by Association?</h1>

      <h4>Stereotype Threat and Myself</h4>
      <p>
          Ethnically speaking, as a Mexican-American, I am at risk of being subject to Stereotype Threat. By definition, the social category, or group, I would be placed in is that which represents Hispanics. There are many negative stereotypes that are associated with Hispanics, but particuarly within the context of Stereotype Threat, common negative stereotypes affecting Hispanics are poor academic performance and lower-tier intelligence levels. The primary question at hand is whether I feel affected by such negative stereotypes, i.e. whether I feel (conciously or subconciously) at risk of confirming such negative stereotypes through my own actions or characteristics. Luckily, from what I understand about myself, this is not the case. However, this has more to do with my ideologies and how I perceive myself, especially after I began my time in college. I determined at that time that the only limitations that can impact me are those which exist within the confines of my own mind. Therefore, as long as I remember that only I can determine what I can and cannot accomplish, the only barriers in my way are those that I place before myself. This is why I always remind myself that I can accomplish anything I want, I can do anything I set my mind on, and the only person that can really stop me is myself. I do not let the negative opinions others have of me impact me for any longer than it takes to remind myself that the only judgement that really matters is my own (at this point, this doesn't take long at all). In this context, negative opinions shouldn't be confused with constructive criticism, which is something I value and welcome. With that said, I haven't always been good at dealing with matters like Stereotype Threat.

      <h4>How I've Been Affected, and How I Plan to Prevent It</h4>

      <p>
          <em>How did it affect your achievement? </em> During my elementary years, I was definitely impact by it, whether it was from teachers or my fellow pupils (the former was the most impactful). However, it eventually led to me being driven to prove them all wrong. Before sixth grade, I did not take school to seriously. That all changed when I met my sixth grade teacher: he believed in me - it was all I ever needed.<br><br>
          <em>What questions did you ask yourself? </em> At times, I wondered if it was really possible for my ethnic background to inhibit my ability to learn effectively. During my college years, I learned that there are many, many factors that negatively impact the ability of anyone to learn effectively. However, while growing up, these were questions that I did not have answer to; I usually just had to push out the negative thoughts.<br><br>
          <em>Did you feel it physically? </em> Emotionally, yes, but physically, not so much. No more than the brain processes emotional pain physically (think of that pain you feel in your heart when you hear about something tragic that has happened to someone close to you, or yourself).<br><br>
          <em>If you thought others were suffering from it, what could you do to help others in that situation? </em> I believe everyone has different means of dealing with things like ignorance and stereotype subjection, and I do not think it would be fair to expect that what works for myself would work for others. Therefore, I believe the most important thing I can do for others in such situations would be to offer words of kindness, encouragement and support, to lend an ear empathetically and be willing to listen, and to never allow myself to be the cause of such suffering, whether as the root cause or a supporter of such ignorance.<br><br>
          <em>Can you identify ways to change your behavior or the environment you're in to make it more welcoming and reduce the impact of stereotype threat? </em> Primarily, to never allow myself to believe that stereotypes have any merit, but also, by not associating myself with those who support stereotypes.<br>
