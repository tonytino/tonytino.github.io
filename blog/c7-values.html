      <h1 class="blog-title">There's More To Life Than Money: Important Values</h1>

      <h4>Values I Value:</h4>
      <p>
        Below are the values that I value the most (no particular order), along with a rating regarding how much I feel like I live up to/live in line with them (scale of 1 to 5, 5 being perfect). I will also provide a brief reason explaining my rating.
        <ul>
          <li>Competence - 4 - I always strive to be quite competent in anything I do, but I could always try harded.</li>
          <li>Challenge - 4 - I love challenges and never turn them down, but I could push myself more.</li>
          <li>Close Relationships - 4 - I value a few close relationships over many, but I could do more to remain in contact.</li>
          <li>Helping Others - 3 - I love to help others, but at this time in my life, I find it hard to always be able to.</li>
          <li>Inner Harmony - 4 - I am quite at peace with myself, but there are still things that I would like to work on.</li>
          <li>Integrity - 5 - Integrity is one of the things I value most and I always try to embody it.</li>
          <li>Intellectual Status - 4 - I push myself to always learn, but I know there's still so much I want to learn.</li>
          <li>Introspection - 5 - As an introvert, I love being in my own head and always make time for it.</li>
          <li>Meaningful Work - 4 - While not something that was true over recent years, I feel like I finally on the right path.</li>
          <li>Music - 3 - I love music, whether listening or playing, I just need to find more time for playing.</li>
          <li>Will-Power - 3 - I feel like I used to be at a 4 before my first professional job, but I'm on track to be there again.</li>
          <li>Wisdom - 4 - I always strive to learn from others, but seeking wisdom is a never-ending quest.</li>
          <li>Tranquility - 4 - While I know I am not perfect, I always strive to be levelheaded and patient.</li>
          <li>Spirituality - 4 - I was off-track for a while, but I feel like I'm on the right path again.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h4>Questions About My Values:</h4>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Of those above, the most important one for myself is: Wisdom.<br>
          Wisdom is an amazing thing because with wisdom comes so much more. A wise man's intelligence is never at question, nor is their inner harmony, tranquility, or spirituality. Further, they always display strong will-power and they are always so at peace with themselves. While there is much more I strive to encompass, I know that by being a very wise individual, I will encompass many of my desired values.</li>
          <li>What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on? Did it relate to any of the values you found important?<br>It was about me quitting my last job to pursue Dev Bootcamp. A co-worker of mine was interested in chasing after a job he was interested in, but was nervous about leaving San Diego as he grew up there. This was related to close relationships in a way because I consider him a dear friend. In a way, it also relates to helping others.</li>
          <li>How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?<br>I feel great about my values and I believe they have defined my life, all of which I've developed and have helped me achieve so much. I also believe my values are what have helped me become so at peace with myself, which has helped me avoid being a target of things like stereotype threat.</li>
          <li>Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?<br>I believe one of the most important things I can do for myself is using my time wisely and making the most of my entire experience at DBC. Doing so will allow me to continue to be at peace with myself and prevent any unnecessary stress.</li>
