      <h4>Concrete Random / Abstract Sequential: My Thinking Styles</h4>

      <p>Based on what I've learned about my thinking styles, I feel like I have done a decent job of implementing strategies that help me excel. For example: I try to think through problems first, such as through pseudocode. I use logic naturally as a part of programming, but I also take it a step further and try to understand what native methods do on my behalf. I also like to utilize consoles so I can test changes I make to code as frequently and quickly as possible. Lastly, one of my concerns was my natural desire to work independently (I excel when working alone) - I have made it a top goal of mine to become much more comfortable working in pairing settings so that I can excel in either situation and prove to be a strong resource on any team. So far, pairings have been successful and feedback seems to suggest that I'm addressing this concern well.

        My biggest struggle at DBC thus far has been trying to fit some many things into my daily schedule, which luckily, should begin to clear up substantially. Until recently (Monday 9, 2015), I have been working full-time and my days have been completely booked, with many long, long nights. Despite being done with work now, my to-do list is still very long, with having to move this upcoming weekend, saying goodbye to close friends and family, getting affairs in San Diego wrapped up, etc. I have found this to be my largest issue, which is why I am so excited to close this chapter of my life and begin the new one titled "DBC and beyond!". As far as learning goes, I have felt very comfortable with the learning requirements and have been having a blast learning and practicing. This is definitely where I am supposed to be. :)

      <h4>Growth Vs Fixed Mindset: Ways to Improve My Learning and Thinking</h4>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>I've noticed allocating time for things and time-boxing have helped dramatically. Therefore, I would like to explore similar ideas to see if I can add to these benefits.</li>
          <li>I would like to increase my retention of material - therefore, I can try to relearn something I've learned from one source by using another source to supplement, or add onto, what I've already learned.</li>
          <li>I would like to begin comparing my approach to the approaches of others (problem solving wise, and other topics). Pairing has demonstrated how different everyone thinks and how useful some strategies are compared to those I may be applying.</li>
