      <h4>Concrete Random / Abstract Sequential:</h4>

      <p>My biggest struggle at DBC thus far has been trying to fit some many things into my daily schedule, which luckily, should begin to clear up substantially. Because I have been working up until Monday 9, 2015, my days have been completely booked, with many long, long nights. Despite being done with work, my to-do list is still very long, with having to move this upcoming weekend, saying goodbye to close friends and family, etc. I have found this to be my largest issue, which is why I am so excited to close this chapter of my life and begin the new one titled "DBC and beyond!". As far as learning goes, I have felt very comfortable with the learning requirements and have been having a blast learning and practicing. This is definitely where I am supposed to be. :)

      <h4>Growth Vs Fixed Mindset: Ways to Improve My Learning &amb; Thinking</h4>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>I've noticed allocating time for things and time-boxing have helped dramatically. Therefore, I would like to explore similar ideas to see if I can add to these benefits.</li>
          <li>I would like to increase my retention of material - therefore, I can try to relearn something I've learned from one source by using another source to supplement, or add onto, what I've already learned.</li>
          <li>I would like to begin comparing my approach to the approaches of others (problem solving wise, and other topics). Pairing has demonstrated how different everyone thinks and how useful some strategies are compared to those I may be applying.</li>
