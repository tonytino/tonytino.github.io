      <h4>Conflict is also a Test of Character</h4>
      <p>
         <ul>
           <li>
             Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?:<br><br>
             My roommate was my oldest best friend, someone I've known since second grade and have been friends with the entire time. There were some things we couldn't agree on and I decided I was going to move out so I can save money (live with my parents for a few months) and put a cease to the arguments - I care more about his friendship than arguing.
           </li><br>
           <li>
             What was the source of the conflict?:<br><br>
             We just didn't see eye to eye on how things should be managed around the house - a classic mismatch in terms of how the tenants want things kept. In essesce, it was trivial and there wasn't any reason for us to argue over preferences.
           </li><br>
           <li>
             What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?:<br><br>
             At first, it was plenty of frustration. But it was also a lot of confusion and a deep sense of being at a loss for direction. I wasn't sure what to do at first, but I decided that it made much more sense for me to save up a small savings while living at home and reflect on what I needed to change about myself.
           </li><br>
           <li>
             What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?:<br><br>
             We agreed to find someone to sublease, which proved much easier than imaginable. We didn't really talk for a couple months, just gave each other some space, then reconnected and left it in the past. I couldn't be happier about how it all worked out - he's like a brother to me, and is in some ways, part of the reason I'm in Dev Bootcamp now too.
           </li><br>
           <li>
             If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?:<br><br>
             I'd change the way I behaved before making the decision to move out.
           </li><br>
           <li>
             What did you learn from this experience?:<br><br>
             I knew I could have handled things better before moving out - I am sure there were plenty of times where I was just being unbearable or unreasonable. I strive to be much more levelheaded and pragmatic - ideologies become constant thoughts, which become actions, which become habits, which become a way of life.
