      <h4>Pairing:</h4>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</li>
        At first, it was very nerve-wrecking and intimidating because of feelings like self-doubt. What made it worse was wondering if you were being judged about how much you know. But once you get past these silly emotions and realize these are the wrong things to be focused on, it makes it easy to learn and benefit from pairing. Some of the most important lessons I've learned have come from pairing, and I certainly have benefitted in multiple ways, such as learning to approach things from different angles than my own.
          <li>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</li>
        More than anything else, making friends and accomplishing things together. The feeling of satisfaction is even greater when you get to your end goal with someone else.
          <li>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</li>
        Sometimes, personalities don't always mesh well right away, which can make communicating difficult, especially if it's not entirely your fault (you're never not at fault in some way, though). Being able to find a way to make it work and still coming out ahead in the end is what makes it all worth it. You also learn how to work with others who may not be the best person for you to work with - life isn't always perfect, but being able to adapt successfully is an important skill to surviving (or succeeding in this case).
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h4>Feedback:</h4>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</li>
          It's so rewarding!!! Seeing how people respond to things you do to make them feel more comfortable working with you, especially things that most people wouldn't ever feel comfortable telling you to your face, it amazing how it makes you feel. I used to wonder about how people felt about working with me during my time in my Finance career, and this provides a way of finding that out. What's even better is you can adapt when people mention things that you can improve on - this is crucial to growing as a person.
          <li>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</li>
          Absolutely. I've been able to address concerns raised and have received feedback suggesting that I've improved substantially. It's comments like those that make the effort worthwhile.
          <li>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</li>
          Most of the feedback I've received has been positive. Often, I hear that I'm very open to exploring new ideas or concepts, which may be my idea or my pair's. We usually learn a lot from this, and they're appreciative of my willingness to make time for such. Therefore, this is something that I won't stop doing. I sometimes worry about whether my pair is concerned about their time, but the feedback I've received suggests otherwise, so I won't hesitate to be willing to continue exploring.
          <li>How was it to write feedback?</li>
          It's great because you know you're helping someone else grow, especially after seeing how beneficial feedback is for yourself. It's also nice to be able to voice concerns without worrying about someone holding it against you, as the feedback is always for their benefit, never to hurt any feelings. The anonymity helps prevent it from being personal.
          <li>What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</li>The most challenging part can be finding meaningful feedback that will actually help someone when they already seem to be so perfect. I just have to remind myself that no one's perfect, and you only cheat them from being able to grow by not thinking harder about how they can improve further.
          <li>Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?</li>
          I really have come to enjoy it much more than I thought I would. I certainly try to pair at least once more than we're expected to each week because I find it so beneficial and because of how much I always learn. Plus, it's wonderful to make friends and build friendships.
        </ul>
